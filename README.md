The Pomodoro technique is very effective in focusing while working.
The Pomodoro timer is built with C++ programming language. 
The timer executes the code in the terminal, takes input of the duration of working and break time, and shows the time remaining in each session.
The timer is simple to use.
Enjoy!!
